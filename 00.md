_(Remember: Block 3: Implement Core Features & Security was the focus of the phase just completed/evaluated)._

### **➡️ Block 4: Tidy Mocks & Test Reliability 🧹✨**

- **🎯 Goal:** Make sure test mocks are working well & tests run smoothly after recent changes.
- **📋 Todos:**
  - `[ ]` Fix any _new_ test issues caused by Block 3 features (if any pop up).
  - `[ ]` Check test console noise (like that `getPostById mock` error message).
  - `[ ]` Double-check authentication mocks are still solid.
  - `[ ]` Ensure tests clean up after themselves (re-check `--detectOpenHandles`).
  - `[ ]` _(Maybe Later)_ Improve tricky mocks if needed (like file uploads).

### **➡️ Block 5: More Tests & Code Polish 🧪💅**

- **🎯 Goal:** Write **more tests** to cover more code and **clean up** the remaining code quality issues.
- **📋 Todos:**
  - `[ ]` ✍️ Write **Unit Tests**! (Especially for Services: `PostService`, `AuthService`, etc.).
  - `[ ]` ➕ Add more **Integration Tests** (API error cases, comments, notifications).
  - `[ ]` 📈 Increase test **coverage goal** (e.g., to 70-80%) & make tests meet it.
  - `[ ]` ✨ Fix **all remaining lint warnings** (especially `no-unused-vars`, `explicit-function-return-type`).
  - `[ ]` ⬆️ Update project **dependencies** (libraries).

---

### **➡️ Block 6: Get Ready for Launch! 🚀📄**

- **🎯 Goal:** Add final **documentation**, setup files, and touches needed for **real-world use**.
- **📋 Todos:**
  - `[ ]` 📖 Create formal **API Documentation** (like Swagger/OpenAPI).
  - `[ ]` 📝 Improve the **README** file (clear setup, usage instructions).
  - `[ ]` 🔑 Create an **`.env.example`** file (listing needed settings).
  - `[ ]` 🐳 Create a **`Dockerfile`** (for easy deployment).
  - `[ ]` 👀 Review and improve **logging**.
  - `[ ]` _(Maybe Later)_ Revisit tricky `any` types skipped earlier (index signatures, mock issues) if desired.

---

### **⏸️ (Paused) Block 2: Finish Deep Lint Fixes 🕵️‍♀️**

- **🎯 Goal:** Fix the tricky **lint warnings** skipped earlier (mostly `any` types).
- **📋 Todos:**
  - `[ ]` Fix deferred `any` warnings (index signatures, `mockSetup.ts` lines) **if/when** unblocked or decided necessary.

This breakdown focuses on the _next actionable blocks_ (4, 5, 6) and keeps the paused linting block separate for clarity. Hope this helps keep things on track!
