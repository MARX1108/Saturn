**Overall Assessment & Next Steps:**

- **Step 1: Build & Test Execution:**

  - Verify `yarn tsc --noEmit` still runs cleanly within `packages/server`.
  - Briefly assess the final state of `packages/server/jest.config.js` and `packages/server/babel.config.js` - do they look standard and clean now?
  - Are the root Jest config warnings (`/Users/marxw/Saturn/jest.config.js`) confirmed fixed (containing only `projects`)?

- **Step 2: Baseline Test Pass Rate:**

  - Confirm that `test/routes/auth.test.ts`, `test/routes/actors.test.ts`, and `test/routes/posts.test.ts` are passing based on the last run.
  - Identify other test suites within `packages/server` (e.g., under `src/repositories/__tests__/`, `src/services/__tests__/`). What is their likely status based on previous runs or current code state (e.g., did `actorRepository.test.ts` previously time out? Do service tests exist?)?
  - What is the overall test pass rate for `packages/server` currently? What are the main categories of failure in the remaining suites (if known)?
  - Report current code coverage figures if readily available (or state they are likely still low ~10%).

- **Step 3: Type Safety (`any` Elimination):**

  - Scan `packages/server/src` and `packages/server/test`. Are there significant remaining uses of `any` type (explicit or implicit)?
  - Check key interfaces/types (e.g., `ServiceContainer`, controller method signatures, repository method signatures, main data models). Are they well-defined or are there gaps?

- **Step 4: Feature Integration (Notifications, Comments):**

  - Check `src/modules/notifications` and `src/modules/comments`. Do they have defined services, controllers, routes?
  - Are these modules integrated? (e.g., Does `PostService` call `NotificationService`? Are their routes included in `src/routes/index.ts`?).
  - Do these modules have corresponding tests?

- **Step 5: Input Validation:**

  - Is a validation library (`zod`, `express-validator`, etc.) installed?
  - Check key controller methods (e.g., `AuthController.register`, `PostsController.createPost`). Is input validation middleware being applied to the corresponding routes?

- **Step 6: Security & Error Handling:**

  - Is rate-limiting middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit`) implemented anywhere in `testApp.ts` or `src/app.ts`?
  - Review `src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` (or equivalent). Does it hide stack traces in production (`process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`)?
  - Check a sample async controller method. Does it use `try/catch` or rely solely on the global error handler via promise rejection?

- **Step 7-10 (Brief Assessment):**
  - Briefly assess the state of unit testing for services/repositories (Step 7).
  - Briefly assess the DI mechanism used in production code (`src/config/serviceContainer.ts`) - is it still manual factories? (Step 8).
  - Briefly check key dependency versions (`express`, `mongodb`, `typescript`) listed in `packages/server/package.json` (Step 9).
  - Are there signs of API documentation generation or deployment scripts (Dockerfile)? (Step 10).

1.  **Type Safety Crisis:** The 127 `tsc` errors and widespread `any` usage (both implicit and explicit) are the most critical blockers. This severely undermines reliability and maintainability. Fixing these is **Step 1 priority**. This involves:

    - Installing all missing `@types/*` packages.
    - Resolving module path issues (e.g., `../../../../tests/helpers/...`).
    - Addressing the explicit and implicit `any` types revealed by `tsc` and `grep`.
    - Correcting type mismatches in models, repositories, services, and especially tests (e.g., `Actor` type issues in `actorRepository.test.ts`, `ServiceContainer` inconsistencies).

2.  **Incomplete Test Suite:** While core routes pass, the repository and service tests are broken (due to type errors) or missing (`comments`, `notifications`). The overall pass rate and coverage are very low. Getting `tsc` clean is a prerequisite for fixing and expanding tests.

3.  **Partial Feature Integration:** `Comments` and `Notifications` exist but aren't fully wired up (routes not mounted in `index.ts` though they seem to be configured in `index.ts` later? There's conflicting information there - `routes/index.ts` doesn't show them, but `src/index.ts` does seem to mount them. Let's assume `src/index.ts` is the source of truth). They lack tests.

4.  **Missing Fundamentals:** Input validation and rate limiting are completely absent.

**Conclusion:**

The server is currently in a **fragile state** despite the successful Jest refactoring. The immediate next phase must focus entirely on **achieving type safety (fixing all `tsc` errors)**. Only after the codebase compiles cleanly can we reliably address the failing tests, implement missing features (validation, rate limiting), complete module integration, and improve test coverage.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1.  **Fix `tsc` errors:** Install missing `@types` packages, resolve `any` types, fix type mismatches. This will likely touch many files, especially tests and models.
2.  **Run Tests:** Once `tsc` passes, run `yarn test` in `packages/server` to identify remaining test failures beyond type errors.
3.  **Fix Failing Tests:** Address logic errors, mock issues, or timeouts in the existing test suites (`actorRepository`, `postService`, etc.).
4.  **Implement Input Validation:** Choose a library (e.g., `zod`) and add validation middleware to routes, starting with critical ones like auth and post creation.
5.  **Implement Rate Limiting:** Add basic rate limiting.
6.  **Complete Feature Integration:** Ensure `comments` and `notifications` routes are correctly mounted and functional.
7.  **Write Missing Tests:** Add unit/integration tests for `comments`, `notifications`, and other uncovered areas.
